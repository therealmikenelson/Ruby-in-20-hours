Git
Git-Hub
Heroku

Git
Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without 
stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system.

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything 
from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses 
SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, 
convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

Heroku
Heroku is the leading open language cloud application platform and supports Ruby, 
Java, Python, Clojure, Scala, Node.js. and custom language buildpacks.

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. 
Heroku is owned by Salesforce.com.[1] Heroku, one of the first cloud platforms, has been 
in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but has 
since added support for Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure and Python and (undocumented) PHP and Perl. 
The base operating system is Debian or, in the newest stack, the Debian-based Ubuntu.[2]
